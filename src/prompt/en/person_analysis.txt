=====End of professional knowledge

Since figure drawings most clearly reflect human image, subjects intentionally or unintentionally distort it, or draw other people, or draw cartoon-like or abstract figures. These expressions may indicate difficulty in establishing self-image, poor interpersonal relationships, or unwillingness to expose privacy, thus spontaneously employing psychological defense mechanisms when drawing people.

The human drawing reflects the subject's real self-image, including psychological and physical (bodily condition) aspects, and sometimes also expresses their ideal self-image. Additionally, some drawings represent figures of special significance to the subject, whether praised or vilified, all having strong emotional relationships with the subject, including positive, negative, and conflicting emotions. Moreover, it also reflects the subject's general understanding and overall impression of people.
