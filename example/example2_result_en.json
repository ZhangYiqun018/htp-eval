        "analysis": "Based on the features extracted by the assistant and the professional knowledge provided, I'll analyze the person drawn in this House-Tree-Person (HTP) test image:\n\n## Gender Analysis\n- The figure is differentiated as female through clothing (simple dress) and a hair accessory (bow).\n- Drawing a female figure first may indicate the subject is female, as people generally draw their own gender first.\n- The prominent female characteristics suggest comfort with feminine identity.\n\n## Character Type\n- The cartoon-like figure could indicate:\n  1. Some wariness towards the test\n  2. Possible anxiety in interpersonal relationships\n  3. A tendency to avoid deep social interactions\n  4.

Willingness to face situations directly\n\n## Body Part Features\n- The simple, normal representation of most body parts indicates:\n  1. No significant bodily concerns or dysmorphia\n  2. A straightforward, uncomplicated view of self and others\n\n## Facial Features\n- Simple facial features with a smiling expression suggest:\n  1. Generally positive outlook\n  2.

Less focus on complex self-image\n  2. Straightforward approach to self-presentation\n- Bow in hair suggests:\n  1. Attention to femininity\n  2. Some degree of vanity or desire for attractiveness\n  3. Possible youthfulness or playfulness\n\n## Overall Impression\nThe drawing presents a simplified, positive female figure.

There are no obvious signs of psychological distress or body image issues. The right-aligned position and frontal view indicate a future-oriented perspective and willingness to engage with the world.\n\nWhile the cartoon style might suggest some guardedness, it doesn't appear to be severe.

        "analysis": "Based on the features extracted by the assistant and the professional knowledge provided, I'll analyze the image in detail:\n\n## Sense of Distance\nThe image shows an appropriate distance between elements, suggesting adequate mobility, a good sense of reality, calmness, and planning ability in the individual. This indicates a balanced perception of their environment and relationships.\n\n## Size Proportion\nThe normal size proportion of the elements in the drawing indicates a balanced self-perception and realistic view of the individual's place in their environment. It suggests neither an inflated sense of self-importance nor feelings of insignificance.\n\n## Position\nThe elements are positioned without any notable abnormality. The house is centrally placed, which in adults might indicate some inner uneasiness and efforts to maintain inner balance and self-control. The tree and person are appropriately placed, suggesting a generally balanced outlook on life and relationships.\n\n## Lines\nThe drawing features both straight lines (in the house structure) and smooth curves (in the tree and clouds). This combination suggests a balance between self-assertiveness and flexibility. The straight lines indicate some level of rigidity or structure in thinking, while the smooth curves point to femininity, dependency, freedom, and good adaptability. The overall smoothness of the lines suggests good self-control and appropriate control over actions.\n\n## Shadows and Shading\nThe absence of shading in the drawing is noteworthy. This lack of shading might indicate an absence of significant anxiety or internal conflicts at the conscious level. It could suggest a relatively straightforward and uncomplicated emotional state.\n\n## Erasure Marks\nThe absence of erasure marks indicates decisiveness and self-confidence in the drawer. It suggests that the individual is comfortable with their initial choices and doesn't feel the need to constantly revise or perfect their work.\n\n## Symmetry\nThe drawing shows normal symmetry, which is a positive sign. It suggests a well-integrated personality, emotional balance, and the ability to maintain equilibrium in various life situations.\n\n## Transparency\nNo abnormal transparency is observed, indicating a clear distinction between internal and external worlds, and a healthy sense of boundaries.\n\n## Dimensionality\nThe normal, eye-level view of the scene suggests a realistic perspective on life. The individual likely has a grounded approach to their environment and relationships, neither feeling superior nor inferior to others.\n\n## Direction\nThe house, tree, and person are all facing front, which could indicate a somewhat rigid personality or an uncompromising attitude. However, in this simple, child-like drawing style, it may just represent a straightforward, open approach to life.\n\n## Level of Detail\nThe normal level of detail in the drawing suggests an awareness of practical and concrete aspects of daily life. The individual shows a balanced concern for self-management ability without being overly fixated on minute details.\n\n## Movement\nThere is no significant movement depicted in the drawing. The static nature of the scene might indicate a preference for stability and routine, or it could simply be a reflection of the simple, snapshot-like quality of the drawing.\n\n## Ground Line\nThe ground line appears normal, suggesting a stable foundation and a sense of security in the individual's life. There are no signs of anxiety or uncertainty related to the ground representation.\n\nIn conclusion, this drawing generally presents a balanced and positive psychological profile. The individual appears to have a stable sense of self, good adaptability, and a realistic view of their environment. There are no significant red flags indicating severe psychological issues, though there might be a slight tendency towards rigidity or conventional thinking."

        "analysis": "Based on the image features provided and the professional knowledge for house content analysis, I'll analyze the drawing in order:\n\n## 1. House Theme\nThe house appears to be a private residence, which reflects a focus on personal life and family. This suggests that the subject places importance on their home environment and family relationships.\n\n## 2. Roof\nThe roof is present but described as having a \"faint roofline.\" This could indicate that the subject feels somewhat overwhelmed by their inability to self-control or maintain boundaries. It may suggest some level of insecurity or a sense of being unable to fully protect oneself from external pressures.\n\n## 3. Walls\nThe walls are described as having \"emphasized wall outlines.\" This is an interesting feature that, according to the professional knowledge, may indicate an early-stage mental illness patient striving to maintain self-balance and personality integration. However, without further context, it could also simply suggest a desire for structure and clear boundaries in one's life.\n\n## 4. Doors\nThe door is described as \"small.\" This could indicate antisocial tendencies, avoidance of social interaction, or a sense of powerlessness. The subject might feel hesitant about fully engaging with the outside world or may perceive themselves as having limited access to opportunities.\n\n## 5. Windows\nThe windows are described as \"plain window openings without decoration.\" This suggests a realistic and blunt personality. The subject may be someone who easily expresses emotions in daily life and prefers straightforward communication.\n\n## 6. Chimney and Smoke\nThere is no smoke mentioned, which doesn't provide much information for analysis in this case.\n\n## 7. Fences and Ditches\nNo fences or ditches are present in the drawing. This absence might suggest that the subject doesn't feel a strong need for additional defensive barriers beyond the house itself.\n\n## 8. Awnings and Sunshades\nNo awnings or sunshades are present, which doesn't provide additional information for analysis.\n\n## 9. Flowers and Trees\nThere is a tree with apples drawn next to the house. While it's not directly related to the family, it could represent a desire for growth, nourishment, or fruitfulness in life. It might also indicate a connection to nature or a wish for a nurturing environment.\n\n## 10. Roads, Mountains\nA winding path is present, which could indicate vigilance or a lack of sociability. It might suggest that the subject perceives the journey of life or social interactions as complex and potentially challenging.\n\n## 11. Other Accessories\nNo additional accessories are mentioned that would require analysis under this category.\n\nIn conclusion, this house drawing presents a mixed picture. The subject appears to value their home and family life but may struggle with feelings of insecurity or powerlessness. There's a suggestion of potential difficulty with social interactions or engagement with the outside world. However, the presence of the apple tree and the overall simplicity of the drawing could indicate a desire for growth and straightforward communication. The emphasized wall outlines are particularly noteworthy and might warrant further exploration to understand if they represent a coping mechanism for maintaining psychological balance."

Theme\n- **Tree species**: Not specified, but appears to be a fruit tree (likely an apple tree)\n- **Leaf type**: Not clearly depicted, but the presence of fruits suggests a deciduous tree\n- **Tree condition**: Healthy and bearing fruit, indicating vitality and productivity\n\n### II.

The medium size and proportionate features suggest a stable self-image. The cloud-like crown and smooth texture indicate good social skills and adaptability. The presence of fruits implies a sense of productivity and accomplishment in life.\n\nThe gradually dividing branches suggest a flexible thought process and good problem-solving skills. The absence of scars or unusual features in the trunk or branches may indicate a lack of significant unresolved trauma or stress.\n\nHowever, the hill-like ground and the presence of clouds might suggest some underlying feelings of loneliness or mild concerns. The small sun could indicate an awareness of positivity in life, but perhaps not fully embracing or focusing on it.\n\nIn conclusion, this tree drawing seems to depict an individual who is generally well-adjusted, socially capable, and productive, but may have some mild underlying emotional needs or concerns that aren't overwhelming their overall positive outlook."

    "final": "<output>\n\n# HTP Test Opinion\n\n## Assessment Evaluation\n\n1. Formal Analysis\n\nThe subject's HTP test results reveal a well-integrated personality with a balanced self-perception. The drawings demonstrate good reality testing, emotional stability, and adequate planning abilities. The centrally placed elements and the combination of straight lines and smooth curves suggest a individual striving for inner balance while maintaining a degree of flexibility. The absence of shading and erasure marks indicates minimal anxiety at the conscious level and a sense of self-assurance. However, the static nature of the scene and front-facing elements hint at a preference for stability and potentially rigid thinking patterns in certain situations.\n\n2. Content Analysis\n\n- House: The house drawing reflects a focus on personal life and family dynamics. While the emphasized wall outlines suggest a desire for clear boundaries, the faint roofline may indicate some difficulty in maintaining these boundaries effectively. The small door is a point of concern, potentially signifying antisocial tendencies or feelings of powerlessness in social situations. However, the presence of an apple tree near the house suggests a desire for personal growth and nourishment.\n\n- Tree: The tree representation is particularly positive, indicating vitality, productivity, and good adaptability. The healthy, fruit-bearing tree with a straight trunk and gradually dividing branches suggests a balanced self-image and healthier thought patterns. The cloud-like crown implies harmonious interpersonal relationships, although the hill-like ground may represent underlying feelings of loneliness or a need for protection.\n\n- Person: The person drawing reveals comfort with feminine identity and a generally positive outlook. The cartoon-like style might indicate some wariness towards the assessment process or mild anxiety in interpersonal relationships. However, the frontal view, normal proportions, and smiling expression suggest openness to engagement and a balanced self-perception. The right-aligned position indicates future-oriented thinking and a desire for social interaction.\n\n3. Summary\n\nThe HTP test results present a predominantly positive psychological profile. The subject demonstrates emotional stability, a balanced self-perception, and good adaptability. There are indications of productivity, future-oriented thinking, and a generally positive outlook on life. However, some areas of concern emerge, particularly regarding potential feelings of being overwhelmed, possible antisocial tendencies, and underlying feelings of loneliness.\n\n21 positive signals, 2 negative signals, strength of negative signal information: low to moderate, strength of positive signal information: strong\n\nNo immediate warning or observation required. However, it may be beneficial to monitor the subject's social engagement patterns and coping strategies for managing feelings of being overwhelmed.\n\n</output>",
